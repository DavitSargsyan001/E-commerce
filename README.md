## About the Project

MyECommerceApp is a Java-based desktop application developed as a project for the COMP 380 Introduction to Software Engineering class at California State University Northridge. The application simulates an E-commerce store, providing users with features such as product browsing, user registration, shopping cart management, and order placement.

The primary goal of this project is to apply software engineering principles, design patterns, and best practices to build a functional and well-structured application. The application uses Java's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, Swing for GUI components, and Git for version control.
